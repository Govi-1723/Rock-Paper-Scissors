# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game 

## Iteration 1 (DONE)
- Created a simple version of the game using HTML and JavaScript.
- The player chooses rock, paper, or scissors.
- The computer picks randomly.
- The result (win, lose, or tie) is shown on screen.

### Files:
- `Iteration1/index.html` â€” Basic working game.

## Iteration 2 (Upcoming)
- Add scoring system.
- Allow multiple rounds.

## Iteration 3 (Upcoming)
- Create a GUI with animations.

## Branching and Merging Strategy

To manage the development process effectively, a Git branching strategy was implemented. Each iteration of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game was developed in its own branch:

- `iteration-1`: Implemented a simple user vs computer game.
- `iteration-2`: Added scoring system and support for multiple rounds.
- `iteration-3`: Introduced a graphical user interface (GUI) with basic animations.

For each iteration:
1. A new branch was created from the `master` branch.
2. Code changes were committed regularly with clear messages.
3. After completing an iteration, a **pull request** was opened and merged into `master`.
4. A version **tag** was created after each successful merge:
   - `v1.0` for Iteration 1
   - `v2.0` for Iteration 2
   - `v3.0` for Iteration 3

This approach helped isolate development stages, reduced merge conflicts, and maintained a clean commit history.
